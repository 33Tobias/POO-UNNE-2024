# 📚 Object-Oriented Programming - Java (UNNE 2024)

This repository contains all my coursework, study materials, exercises and projects from the **Object-Oriented Programming (POO)** course at **UNNE (Universidad Nacional del Nordeste)**.

Throughout this subject, I built a strong foundation in Java and applied all concepts in real scenarios through practices, a final exam program and a full **integrative project**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- 📖 **Course Materials** → Syllabus, planning and theory.
- 📚 **Theory and Final Preparation** → Notes, solved exercises and my final exam program.
- 🧰 **Practices** → Guided exercises and classwork to master OOP fundamentals.
- 🏗️ **Integrative Project** → The final and most challenging project, putting everything together.

## 🚀 What I learned and applied

### ✅ Java Fundamentals
- Syntax, variables, control structures, and data types.
- Methods and modular code.

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects** → Creating and managing objects.
- **Attributes and Methods** → Encapsulation and behavior.
- **Constructors and Overloading** → Flexible and clean code design.
- **Inheritance** → Building hierarchies and reusing code.
- **Polymorphism** → Flexible and dynamic behavior for objects.

### ✅ File Handling
- Reading and writing to text files.
- Managing persistent data for projects.

### ✅ Integrative Project (Main Highlight)
The final project was the culmination of everything learned:
- Created a full Java application from scratch.
- Applied **classes, inheritance, lists/arrays, and file handling**.
- Designed a **user-friendly menu-driven interface**.
- Achieved **real-life problem solving** using structured OOP code.
- Delivered a well-documented and fully working software solution.

### ✅ Final Exam Project
- Developed a complete application to solve a problem under exam conditions.
- Focused on writing efficient and clean code while demonstrating understanding of OOP principles.
