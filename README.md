# 📚 Object-Oriented Programming - HOLA 2024

This repository contains all my coursework, study materials, exercises, and projects from the **Object-Oriented Programming (POO)** course at **UNNE (Universidad Nacional del Nordeste)**.

Throughout this subject, I built a solid foundation in Java and applied all concepts in real scenarios, with the highlight being a comprehensive **Integrative Project**, which involved solving a complete problem using Object-Oriented principles.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- 📖 **Course Materials** → Program, planning, and theory.
- 📚 **Theory and Final Exam Preparation** → Notes, solved exercises, and exam projects.
- 🧰 **Practical Exercises** → Guided and self-developed exercises to master the core OOP concepts.
- 🏗️ **Integrative Project** → A complete and complex Java project demonstrating everything learned.

---

## 🚀 What I Learned and Applied

### ✅ Java Fundamentals
- Syntax, control structures, variables, and data types.
- Modular programming through methods and clean code.

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes and Objects** → Modeling real-world entities.
- **Encapsulation** → Data hiding and method exposure.
- **Inheritance** → Reusing and extending classes.
- **Polymorphism** → Designing flexible and dynamic software.
- **Abstraction** → Building reusable and maintainable code structures.

### ✅ Advanced Programming Concepts
- **File Handling** → Reading and writing to text files for persistence.
- **Exception Handling** → Managing runtime errors robustly.
- **UML Diagrams & Documentation** → Designing and documenting code with clarity.

## 🏆 Integrative Project (Main Highlight)

The final **Integrative Project** was the ultimate challenge and demonstration of my skills in Object-Oriented Programming. 

**Objectives and Achievements:**
- ✅ Designed and implemented a complete Java application from scratch.
- ✅ Applied OOP concepts: classes, inheritance, collections, exception handling, and polymorphism.
- ✅ Developed a modular, organized, and maintainable codebase.
- ✅ Included persistent data storage through files.
- ✅ Designed a user-friendly, menu-driven interface.
- ✅ Worked in a team-based scenario, dividing tasks and integrating modules seamlessly.

The project reflected my ability to solve complex real-life problems, combining programming skills, design patterns, and team collaboration — just like real software projects.

## 🎓 Final Exam Project

As part of the evaluation process, I developed a full standalone Java program demonstrating:
- Proper use of OOP concepts.
- Clean code with correct documentation.
- Efficient problem-solving under exam conditions.
