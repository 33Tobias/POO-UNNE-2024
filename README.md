# 🎓 Object-Oriented Programming - UNNE 2024

This repository brings together all the exercises, study materials, theory and projects developed during the **Object-Oriented Programming (POO)** course at **UNNE - Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales y Agrimensura (FaCENA)**.

The highlight of the course was the **Integrative Project**, where I combined all acquired knowledge into a comprehensive real-world software solution using Java and advanced OOP techniques.

## 🚀 Main Topics and Concepts Applied

### ✅ Java Fundamentals
- Syntax, control structures, data types, and modular programming.
- File handling and exception management.

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Objects** → Modeling real-world entities.
- **Encapsulation** → Controlled access to data.
- **Abstraction** → Simplifying complex systems.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism** → Code reuse and flexible behavior.

> [!TIP]
> Mastering encapsulation and inheritance are key to writing clean, scalable software.

### ✅ Collections and Advanced Use
- Static (arrays) and dynamic (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap) collections.
- Homogeneous vs Heterogeneous collections.
- Efficient storage and retrieval techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic collections like ArrayList greatly improve flexibility compared to fixed-size arrays.

### ✅ UML & Modeling
- Building class diagrams to plan and structure code before implementation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> UML modeling ensures that code remains organized and easier to maintain and expand.

## 🏆 Integrative Project (Main Highlight)

The **Integrative Project** was the most demanding and rewarding part of the course.  
It consisted of creating a complete software solution that:

✅ Managed complex data through classes and inheritance.  
✅ Used polymorphism to handle different object types uniformly.  
✅ Implemented user interaction through menus and file persistence.  
✅ Solved a real-world problem using modular and well-structured Java code.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project required applying all previously learned concepts. Poor design could result in rigid and hard-to-maintain code.

## 🎓 Final Exam Project

In the exam, a full standalone program was developed to:

- Demonstrate proper OOP application.
- Solve problems efficiently under pressure.
- Showcase clean code and proper documentation practices.
